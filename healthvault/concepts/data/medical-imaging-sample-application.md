# HealthVault Medical Imaging Sample Application

The [Medical Image Sample Application on CodePlex](http://healthvaultimaging.codeplex.com/) uses the HealthVault .NET SDK to illustrate working with the medical image study (MIS) data type and the HealthVault streaming interface.

The application can be used to upload imaging studies into a HealthVault record and to list all studies associated with the record. It also includes the ability to create a DOPU package containing medical image studies.
