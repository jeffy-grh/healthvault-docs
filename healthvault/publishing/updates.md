Updating a HealthVault-integrated application
=============================================

This guide describes the process of updating an application that has already been deployed using the <a href="go-live.md" id="PageContent_13986_2">go-live guide</a>.

### Update steps

1.  Finalize your configuration in the [Application Configuration Center (ACC)](https://config.healthvault-ppe.com).
2.  Update your [application walkthrough document](http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/4/E/74EA8944-199C-4F56-B3BB-8105869425BC/HealthVault%20Application%20Walkthrough%20document.docx) to reflect changes to your signup workflow.
3.  Contact the HealthVault go-live team at  [hvgolive@microsoft.com](mailto:HvGoLive@microsoft.com) to request a review of your changes.

### Timetable to expect

-   Allow two to three business days for simple configuration changes.
-   Allow two weeks for significant changes that impact the signup workflow.

### Microsoft HealthVault Solution Provider Agreement

There is therefore no need to reconnect with the [HealthVault Business Development](mailto:hvbd@microsoft.com) team unless you wish to discuss additional partnership ideas or if you want to add <a href="/healthvault/concepts/advanced/master-and-child-applications" id="Introduction_13986_23">master-child</a> access to your application configuration (a special addendum to the agreement is needed in order to use the master-child API).

### Application discoverability

Consider updating the text or screenshots in your existing Application Directory entry.  You can request an update to your directory entry during the App Review process described above.
