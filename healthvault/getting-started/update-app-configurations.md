# Update the configuration of a HealthVault app
You should have already configured an app using the [Application Configuration Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=838954). If you haven't please read [configuring a new app in ACC](configuring-new-app-acc.md) for more information. 

## Samples
If you're starting from one of the HealthVault samples published to GitHub, each of these is configured with a PowerShell script which allows you to easily configure the ApplicationID and environments (as needed). Open a PowerShell console, navigate to the folder you chose for your local repository, then navigate to the project root folder and run the following command, specifying your ApplicationID below.

```powershell
.\\Update-WebConfig.ps1 -ApplicationId "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```

> [!NOTE]
> You may need to enable execution of PowerShell scripts in order to run this script. To do so, open an administrative PowerShell and run
> ```powershell
> Set-ExecutionPolicy -RemoteSigned
> ```

## Specifying ApplicationId manually
Most HealthVault apps leverage a Web.config or app.config to specify the ApplicationId. To specify the ApplicationId manually, find the `<configuration><appSettings>` element, and add `<add key="ApplicationId" value="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" />', inserting your ApplicationId instead of 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000. If you've completed this properly, the config file should look something like this, where other elements may be specified instead of the elipses. 

```xml
<configuration>
  <appSettings>
    ...
    <add key="ApplicationId" value="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" />
    ...
  </appSettings>
</configuration>
...
```

## Specifying the HealthVault instance
During development, your apps should be targeting the PPE environment for HealthVault. Our samples are pre-configured to target the PPE environment in the US instance, but we offer a PowerShell script to switch to the EU instance. 

```xml
.\\Update-WebConfig.ps1 -Environment EU
```

For more information on HealthVault instance configurations, please see [Instance configuration](/healthvault/concepts/advanced/configurations).
